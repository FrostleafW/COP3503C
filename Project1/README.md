Templated Linked List

In this assignment, you are going to create a data structure called a Linked List. A linked list (like many data structures) stores data as a collection of "nodes" (a generic term for a unit of storage), each of which knows about the node before and after it.

This assignment relies completely on the concept of pointers and dynamic memory allocation. Everything covered so far in the course regarding new, delete, pointers, templates, the big three, etc will be put into practice here.
